This program does nothing more than read into a grid
a file containg Windows 10 page names and class id's.
In the grid you can select a page name and I either
'shell' it out or use 'file explorer' to show that page.
There are about two hundred pages to display.

My O/S is Windows 10 Prof 64 bit.
I made this little program using c# in VS2019.
Use the W10PageListerSetup.msi file to install.
